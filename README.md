# milk frother holder
A 3D model of a holder for the ikea produkt milk frother, designed in OpenSCAD.

Earlier I accidentally knocked off the milk frother, and bent the rod.
I fix this holder to the my kitchen tiles with double sided tape.
It has a drain hole at the bottom, so water can drain.
It has rounded edges, and rounded top, so the device can slide in the hole easily.
